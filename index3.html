              The lesson I’ve learned is to be wary of those who are. The ones
              who seem to think that being critical is the same as having good
              taste. Those people almost never have good taste, so their
              opinions don’t matter.There’s no particular sophistication
              required to be a critic. We know this, because children often
              dislike foods they learn to love as adults.

                As a child I disliked the Eames LCW chair in my parents’
                bedroom. I took no pleasure in hating it. My feeling separated
                me from my mother, whose taste I have always admired.

                Was Eames a flavor I had to become more sophisticated to enjoy?
                Perhaps. But that dislike, that gap between us in taste, fueled
                a productive thought process. I had to figure out what was so
                great about an object so ugly, so bulbous, so unlike the other
                (normal) chairs in our house. I had to learn about the Eameses,
                about bentwood, about cleaning up “the slum of legs.” If at the
                end of that process I still hated the chair, would I have gained
                less in sophistication? I learned to love the exploration. I
                love the chair too, even though, due to its age and the
                innovative industrial means of its manufacture, it is now
                sculpture rather than furniture.

            My now-husband’s first gift to me was another collection of
            criticism, Michael Sorkin’s Exquisite Corpse. My education in
            criticism up to that date had been establishment; this book was made
            of ruder stuff. It bristles with dislike about some of the very same
            buildings Ada Louise Huxtable loved, and love for those about which
            she was lukewarm. The Ford Foundation. The Whitney. My favorite
            essay in the book is probably the one on the Whitney, an
            all-too-rare love letter to Marcel Breuer intertwined with a
            demolition of Michael Graves and his “shitty beaux-arts apparatus.”
            However quotable, I still wouldn’t call that hating. Sorkin says
            Graves can’t help it, the apparatus is just his way. It’s on the
            rest of us to save the Whitney. Sorkin is simply giving us reasons
            why we should. His conclusion is less important than explaining how
            to get there.

            You must get hundreds of emails a day with products, apps, videos
            and posters that you deem unworthy of publication. Every time you
            don’t publish something, you are being a critic. Yet you don’t share

            in the click of the trash button. What I’d like to hear about is
            what happens in your head between the look and that judgmental
            click. Why this and not that? What’s wrong with that picture?

            You are motivated by a love of design, as am I. Haters are
            name-callers, body-shamers, trolls. They are destructive. If my
            fellow critics and I did not love buildings, books, gadgets and
            food, there would be no reason for us to do what we do. I really
            don’t get paid enough. But as I move through the world of objects, I
            have a lot of questions. I can’t ignore what I dislike or don’t
            understand. Sometimes I describe the way I choose my topics as
            scratching an itch: if something bothers me each time I see it, the
            only salve is investigation. Growing up is doing more than
            complaining (or, as you have said, coming up with a Twitter
            hashtag). Let’s talk about it—as adults, of course. I would like to
            save a building or improve a megaproject, but sometimes the critic
            has to settle for creating a conversation. Maybe this is just the
            long way of saying something very simple: Dear Design, I love you.

            To be able to say, simply and directly, what is wrong (or
            not-yet-right) in design is not a child’s task. I don’t think it is
            possible to educate about design without talking about the world of
            wrong, ugly, misguided and oversize. Yes, swissmiss, like
            Switzerland, might be the exception to that world. But it will never
            be the rule, and accentuating the positive will only reorganize so
            much territory. Today’s Lois Lane cannot avoid the aisles of the can
            compare our Twitter followings), but there’s more constructive work
            to be done below, where so many design blogs fear to dive. You are

            body-shamers, trolls. They are destructive. If my fellow critics and
