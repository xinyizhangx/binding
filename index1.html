          There’s a quote from the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard:
        </p>
        <div class="segment">
          <aside>
            <p>
              “We begin in admiration and end by organizing our disappointment.”
            </p>
          </aside>
          <article>
            <p>
              Now, this is a bit pessimistic—he is a French philosopher, after
              all—but right now the statement does ring true for the technology
              industry. Think about the weight we’ve added to the world:
              attention-greedy devices and services, new business structures
              that turn out to reinforce existing inequalities instead of
              working against them, technocratic blowhards, never mind the
              surveillance shit storm we all now must navigate.
            </p>
            <p>
              How could any self-aware person who works in technology not start
              to organize their disappointment? It’s gotten to where several of
              my peers are floating half-hearted speculations about their next
              careers. This isn’t good: you want the talented and mindful people
              to stick around, not get husked out, then leave frustrated,
              exhausted, and conflicted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The closer I get to it all, the more I become confused and
              overwhelmed. A thing I knew so well has reached out wider and
              wider, only to make less and less sense. So last year, instead of
              being stubborn, complaining, or feeling powerless, I went
              searching for a different perspective. I wanted to take something
              big and make it small again. This was urgent: I needed a way to
              re-engage with my craft on a foundational level. Otherwise, I’d
              also be looking for a second career.

              Can I play something for you? Trust me: it’s worth it. Oh, and
              while you’re listening, pay attention to your chest. You may feel
              a growing warmth, kind of like the fiery trickle after a shot of
              whiskey. Wasn’t that great? I’ve listened to those irritating
              bing-bongs 30 or 40 times in the process of making this page, and
              while you can’t see it, I’m typing this with a big, stupid smile
              on my face. If you came online in the ’90s like me, you’re
              probably smiling too.
            </p>
            <p>
              That sound, of course, is the audio handshake of a modem
              connecting to the internet. And the fiery feeling in the chest it
              creates is the warm pang of nostalgia. I’ve managed to tether that
              grating sound to all the wonder and magic I felt my first years on
              the internet. Back then, if you told me that I’d get to spend the
              next decade or so making things for the web—well, that would be
              just about the best news I could be told.
            </p>
            <p>
              But things have changed, as they always do. I’m writing this
              fifteen years after the bing-bongs, and the fascination has faded.
              What happened is what always happens: the wonder I felt was
              diminished by experience. The awe goes—time takes it.

            In Buddhism, there’s something called the beginner’s mind. If you’ve
            ever done any kind of guided meditation, you’re probably familiar.
            It refers to having an attitude of openness, of eagerness. You drop
            your heavy preconceptions and revitalize a practice by finding a new
            way to look at it. Making things for the web started to feel very
            heavy to me, so this seemed to be what I needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most investigations into beginner’s mind eventually lead to the same
            zen koan. It’s a small story, and it goes like this: Before I began
            to practice, mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I began to practice, mountains were no longer mountains and
            rivers were no longer rivers. Now, I have practiced for some time,
            and mountains are again mountains, and rivers are again rivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what’s the lesson? Here’s my take: we eventually work through the
            naive belief that profundity comes from complication. It simply
            isn’t so. Things have enough depth and worth on their own terms. No
            metaphors or analogies are needed for insight, only the willingness
            to listen to the subject speak for itself, even if it contradicts
            received wisdom.I’d like to do some listening today.

                What is there to see when you look at a website as itself? A
                lot, actually, but let’s simplify things down to their core. As
                we go through this, please excuse me for stating the obvious. My
                intent is to describe and document the apparent. Rivers as
                rivers, remember?

                Here we have a very vanilla website. No styles, just markup. All
                defaults.The first thing to notice about this page is that it is
                fluid—it adapts to the width of the viewport to fill it up. We
                can’t quite say it’s responsive, because responsive sites
                require media queries, but this site, like a responsive one,
                isn’t opinionated about the size of the viewport. It works well
                at whatever size you throw at it.

              I think you make what I call “bicycle bear websites.” Why? Because
              my response to both is the same. “Listen bub,” I say, “it is very
              impressive that you can teach a bear to ride a bicycle, and it is
              fascinating and novel. But perhaps it’s cruel? Because that’s not
              what bears are supposed to do. And look, pal, that bear will never
              actually be good at riding a bicycle.”
            </p>
            <p>
              This is how I feel about so many of the fancy websites I see. “It
              is fascinating that you can do that, but it’s really not what a
              website is supposed to do.” For example, behold Apple’s Mac Pro
              website. Same response as the bear on the bicycle: all glee, until
              things go haywire, and you realize it is coming right for you.

              What is this monstrosity? Why does it feel like docking a
              spaceship? Why can’t I scroll? And why is there lag on my fancy
              laptop? What’s that sound? My computer’s fan?
            </p>
            <p>
              Apple’s pursuit of cool yielded an incredibly fragile, willfully
              esoteric website that’s good for no one. And I’m certain you can
              think of a few similar examples of your own: clumsy sites that
              work counter to the inclinations of the web. Back to the zen
              koan—if we see the mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers,
              these are the sites that try to be different, yet end up swimming
              up stream and climbing uphill.

              I believe every material has a grain, including the web. But this
              assumption flies in the face of our expectations for technology.
              Too often, the internet is cast as a wide-open, infinitely
              malleable material. We expect technology to help us overcome
              limitations, not produce more of them. In spite of those promises,
              we typically yield consistent design results.We use flat colors
              and simple gradients, because they’re lightweight, easy to draw
              with CSS, and can easily scale for areas of unknown proportions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sites have large horizontal stripes of content, because of the
              vertical bias I mentioned earlier.We use text as interface,
              because the nuanced but significant differences in technology’s
              abstractions are difficult to communicate visually.Ambient,
              atmospheric, blurred, or tinted photographs become background
              images, because we can’t quite be sure how it will be cropped
              across different viewports. And big type is overlaid on top of
              these images because every client simultaneously wants big images
              and big type. Plus it dances around those text versus image
              scaling problems I showed earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use photography with props, because software is abstract and
              hard to embody, so we show it on a device in a related context to
              have it seem like the product that it is.And mosaics, because
              every page presents a multitude of elements, and we need
              structured ways of showcasing this variety.

              The web is forcing our hands. And this is fine! Many sites will
              share design solutions, because we’re using the same materials.
              The consistencies establish best practices; they are proof of
              design patterns that play off of the needs of a common medium, and
              not evidence of a visual monoculture.
            </p>
            <p>
              So this is a good start, but it is only a start. Could those
              simple sites I showed earlier assist us beyond the page and
              provide a larger way to think? To put a finer point on it: What
              would happen if we stopped treating the web like a blank canvas to
              paint on, and instead like a material to build with?
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out, I found the answer from a painter who also thought
              to step away from the canvas. Let’s have a short art history
              lesson, shall we?

              Meet David Hockney—artist, painter, and conflicted photographer.
              In the early ’80s, he took a small break from painting to pursue
              these mentioned photographic joiners. They were an investigation
              of time and space. Now, that seems really heady, but once you see
              them, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. They kind of
              look like cubist paintings, but much quicker to read. I’d like to
              show you a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Hockney says in the video, he started the project with
              Polaroids. You can see them tiled together here, because each
              individual photo can’t capture the whole picture.
            </p>

        <div class="bottom">

              Inside, Hockney is using redundancy to show action. How many hands
              are there? How many heads does that man have? Two faces in this
              image, but you don’t interpret it as a two-headed man. It is two
              glances at one face—facets of the same thing.

              It’s so seamless, you’d probably not count the faces without me
              mentioning it. You just know, because this is how you see. You
              have a small focal range; your brain stitches the bits together
              into a complete whole. Here’s another piece, even more advanced.
              This one is my favorite, because it’s so economical—like a comic
              strip.

              Do you see what’s changed? Hockney stopped using Polaroids. The
              grid is gone, replaced by overlaid, borderless photos. Nothing cut
              or cropped, nothing tricky. Hockney’s able to do a lot of work
              with only six images. What would this method look like with many
              more? Hockney asked the same question.

              This is The Scrabble Game, and in my opinion, it’s the masterpiece
              from this era of Hockney’s career. This piece is all over the
              place: so many faces, so many hands. The game board is out of sync
              from image to image, so you can actually piece together the plays
              in the order they were made. Also, there are no ends to my
              aggravation about how he does not see he has a word in his tiles.
              (Liqueur, anyone?)So, do you see what’s happened? Recall the first
              joiner I showed you with the Polaroids, and compare it to The
              Scrabble Game.

              Hockney began with an image-making practice that relied on the
              grid necessitated by the Polaroids’ borders and produced a
              rectangular final work. When he switched to normal film, he was
              able to overlay images in any necessary shape that accurately
              described the time and space of a scene. Nobody would set out to
              make a picture with these edges—what you see is what was required
              by the images he managed to snap.

              In essence, Hockney abandoned the notion that a two-dimensional
              work of art needed to exist at a fixed, rectangular size. Instead,
              small individual photos were overlaid and assembled until they
              formed a complete picture. Individually, the photos don’t mean
              much, but collectively they… does this seem familiar? Okay, I’m
              sorry. I’ve tricked you, and we’ve come full circle. We’re back to
              responsive design. Let’s make an analogy.

            On the left, the Mona Lisa. Cliché, but why the hell not? The
            painting, to me, is like designing for the printed page. On the
            right, The Scrabble Game. This assemblage more closely resembles
            designing for a screen. Do you see it? It is control versus
            discovery, uniformity versus multiplicity. With the Mona Lisa, we
            have fixed, uniform edges that can be planned for with a high degree
            of certainty and control. We revere and celebrate this painting
            because of that exquisite control.

            With the joiner, we have a different kind of beauty. It is an
            edgeless surface of unknown proportions, comprised of small,
            individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled
            into a readable whole that documents a moment. Also known as web
            design. Here, I’ll restate what I just said, but this time, imagine
            I’m talking about web design and not the Hockney photos:an edgeless
            surface of unknown proportions comprised of small, individual, and
            variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable
            whole that documents a moment That’s a pretty good description of
            the visual challenges in interaction design, huh?

            In November of 2013, I gave a talk called What Screens Want, where I
            tried to answer what it meant to natively design for screens. I said
            it was something I called flux—the capacity for things to change.
            This could be as showy as animation, but also as simple and
            fundamental as a spreadsheet sorting itself and showing new results.
            You can’t do that on paper. So, designing for screens is managing
            this change over time, and expressing it in clear, communicative,
            and powerful ways. Now, after looking at Hockney’s work for far too
            long, I can add another item to the list: edgelessness.
          </p>

        <div class="line nine">
          <p>
            A lack of edges permeates the web at all levels. You just have to
            look for it:Edgelessness is in the web’s structure: it’s comprised
            of individual pages linked together, so its structure can branch out
            forever.Edgelessness applies to the screens that show the web,
            because they offer an infinite canvas that can scroll in any
            direction for however long. Boy, do we take for granted that a
            screen can show more content than is able to be displayed in a
            single shot.Edgelessness speaks to the diffusion of device and
            viewport sizes. Above is a chart of screen sizes across Android
            devices. How could there be a clear edge on a spectrum with such
            minor differences between each size? And, most interesting to me,
            edgelessness means blurred lines between the disciplines that work
            together to make things for the web. Everyone that I’ve spoken with
            that’s worked on a large responsive project with a big client says
            that the process disrupts workflows, expectations, and work culture.
            Simply put, the edgelessness of the web tears down the constructed
            edges in the company. Everything is so interconnected that nobody
            has a clear domain of work any longer—the walls are gone, so we’re
            left to learn how to collaborate in the spaces where things connect.
            Let’s take a look at how edgelessness affects how we work. Suppose
            you’re about to start a web project with some sketches. How would
            you begin?

            <p>
              We often think making things for the web is a process of
              simplifying—the hub, the dashboard, the control panel are all
              dreams of technology that coalesces, but things have a tendency to
              diverge into a multiplicity of options. We pile on more tools and
              technology, each one increasingly nuanced and minor in its
              critical differences. Clearly, convergence and simplicity make for
              poor goals. Instead, we must aim for clarity. You can’t contain or
              reduce the torrent of technology, but you can channel it in a
              positive direction through proper framing and clear
              articulation.Technology only adds more—it is never this or that;
              it is always this and that.

              So just like Hockney’s joiners, we’re creating assemblages of
              elements, then associating them with the appropriate space.The
              practice of assembling conflicts with most of the terminology we
              have in place for responsive design. Our words make it seem that
              we’re designing how elements break down, but really, we should be
              focusing on how they build up. And this concept, just like the
              layouts we create, can reach out a bit further.

              A quick example from my life: Twitter didn’t replace Facebook. The
              iPad didn’t replace my phone. My phone didn’t replace my TV. Now,
              I watch YouTube on my iPad, toss the video up to my TV, while
              checking Twitter and Facebook on my phone. It’s a little
              constellation of technology. But I keep asking myself: how many
              more things can I juggle? And for how long?

              The answers offered are typically technological solutions.
              Algorithms. Automation. Tiny programs and sets of rules to filter
              out what bursts from the internet’s flue hole. While well
              intentioned (maybe), these answers only become extra points of
              control and influence. Using technology to solve the problems it
              causes is as futile as cleaning a grass stain by rubbing grass on
              it. More technology only amplifies the problems created by an
              abundance of it. This leads to the most pressing question: How far
              out will technology grow? And when does it cross the line of
              comfort?

              We’re building edgeless environments of divergency. Things are
              added in chaos, then if successful, they expanded further and
              further out until they collapse and rearrange. This is probably
              why responsive design feels so relevant, maddening, and divisive:
              its patterns mimic the larger patterns of technology itself.What
              we build is defined and controlled by its unresolvable conflicts.
              In responsive design, it’s the text and image conundrum I showed
              earlier. In other, more grand arenas, there is capital versus
              labor, or collective control versus anarchic individualism. In
              technology, I believe it comes down to the power dynamics of
              convenience.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create convenience—particularly the automated convenience
              technology trades in—someone else must make our choices for us. In
              other words: the less you have to do, the less say you have.Up to
              a point, swapping autonomy for ease is a pretty good trade: who
              wants to run the math on their accounting books or call the
              restaurant to place a delivery order? But if taken too far,
              convenience becomes a Trojan Horse.
            </p>
            <p>
              We cede too much control and become dependent on something we can
              no longer steer. Platforms that promised to bring convenience to a
              process or intimacy to a relationship now wedge themselves into
              the transaction as new middlemen. Then, we’re left to trust in the
              benevolence of those who have the power to mold our dependencies.
              Citing a lot of the concerns I mentioned earlier, those people are
              less responsible and compassionate than we had hoped. In pursuit
              of convenience, we have opened the door to unscrupulous influence.

              You could say that our current technological arrangement has
              spread out too far, and it is starting to look and feel wrong.
              Fortunately, we can treat this over-expansion just like everything
              else I’ve mentioned. We can draw a line, and create a point of
              reassembly for what we’ve made. We can think about how to shift,
              move, and resize the pieces so that they fall back in line with
              our intentions. This power is compounded for those of us who make
