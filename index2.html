            We designers love to fashion ourselves as “problem solvers,” but
            let’s face it: the line between solving problems and creating them
            is blurry at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of
            heels, or a $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural
            extravaganza in the Bois de Boulogne? The truth is, no matter what
            designers say, we have never simply answered problems. The act of
            design vacillates between the functional and the beguiling, often
            performing one while claiming the other. Le Corbusier dismissed the
            architecture of his beaux-arts contemporaries as cloying, while he
            looked longingly to the brutal utility of the grain elevators and
            factories devised by American engineers. A half century later, Rem
            Koolhaas jettisoned function in favor of performance: “functionality
            is boring; performance is about what role the building plays and
            what kind of scene it triggers.” There has long been an ideological
            divide between the utilitarian and the emotional, between rational
            design and the decorative arts, but the balance of power is
            shifting: In the battle between the head and the gut, the gut’s now
            cleaning up.

          The empathy economy is booming. Facts are out, feelings are in. This
          is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand-mania that asserts
          that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the
          IRS needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business
          of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities,
          politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. (Is it only a
          matter of time before we’re debating our intergalactic positioning?)
          Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it
          means, but how it makes us feel. A brand is a promise. It’s the
          putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a
          particular product, place, or individual. So the new handbag makes us
          feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka,
          suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we
          talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently
          delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at
          least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to
          produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to
          experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look
          alike, but it all has to feel alike. Whenever we encounter them we get
          that familiar brand sensation. That tingling tells you its working.

            So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end
            achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian,
            slightly-embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board
            has long been associated with the softer design arts — fashion,
            interiors, styling — that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators
            used them, serious architects didn’t. There’s no science to it,
            simply a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of
            Xeroxed pictures pinned to a foamcore panel or scattered on the
            studio floor, a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere.
            Their very vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don’t
            signify any one thing, but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a
            silky kitty, when juxtaposed with an angora bunny, a desiccated
            dandelion, and an eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the
            corporeal and becomes the essence of fluffiness. For the
            professional brand manager the mood board attempts to render, in a
            handful of swiped images, some vague quintessence that’s difficult
            to achieve with words.

        <article>
          <p>
            For fashion designers who are required to pump out a new set of
            allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential
            and highly confidential way to pinpoint explicit references before
            assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer
            recalls how when she worked at the brand in the 00’s, the mood
            boards were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch
            them. The foamcore was covered in different materials — linen for
            one collection, cotton for another — and the teams was required to
            use specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time,
            never stacked, lest the surface was disturbed. As almost proof of
            how far we’ve come, last spring for his men’s collection, Raf
            Simmons came right out and superimposed his reference images — a
            Japanese block print, an antique postcard, an astronaut — directly
            onto coats and jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to “mood
            boards you’d pin your favorite images to.”

            As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our
            clothes or living room to feel, to how we want our minivan or
            pharmaceutical or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood
            business continues to expand. (A friend recently told me her
            therapist encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the
            feelings related to her recent divorce.) This expansion is fueled,
            in large part, by the sheer overabundance of available images. It’s
            hard to remember that a couple of decades ago, finding pictures of
            things was actually quite arduous and involved countless hours of
            random page flipping. Now a few seconds of furious key-stroking
            produces endless examples to regurgitate. Every possible idea is
            immediately diluted by retroactive references. That glut of images
            is constantly resifted through personal curation tools such as
            Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration websites such as ffffound.com
            or vfiles.com. Such hyper-individualistic online collections, in
            turn, become open-source mood repositories scavenged by branding
            professionals. Why assemble collections of your own when there are
            millions that exist ready for appropriation? Need to evoke cozy
            softness with a vaguely synthetic overtone, an early seventies color
            palette, and just a touch of glam rock? Missile silo chic?
            Mid-century Crimean beach culture? I can guarantee someone out there
            has that covered. There are even Pinterest pages dedicated to
            collecting other mood boards: collections of collections. And then,
            of course, there is Instagram, which turns every individual life
            into a social network mood board. The carefully curated Instagram
            account is essentially a personal image management tool: private
            life as public brand.

        <article>
          <p>
            While the ascendency of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from
            commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the
            question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured
            emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to
            the lurking presence of Big Data. As vast files of meta-data and
            personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in
            god-knows-where, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences
            that at least promise something warmer and more human. When
            everything is available all the time and we’re inundated with
            information in every way, shape and form, we’re left no choice but
            to favor what makes us feel.
