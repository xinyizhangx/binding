          We designers love to fashion ourselves as “problem solvers,” but let’s
          face it: the line between solving problems and creating them is blurry
          at best. What problem is being solved by a $1,500 pair of heels, or a
          $150,000 car, or a $150,000,000 architectural extravaganza in the Bois
          de Boulogne? The truth is, no matter what designers say, we have never
          simply answered problems. The act of design vacillates between the
          functional and the beguiling, often performing one while claiming the
          other. Le Corbusier dismissed the architecture of his beaux-arts
          contemporaries as cloying, while he looked longingly to the brutal
          utility of the grain elevators and factories devised by American
          engineers. A half century later, Rem Koolhaas jettisoned function in
          favor of performance: “functionality is boring; performance is about
          what role the building plays and what kind of scene it triggers.”
          There has long been an ideological divide between the utilitarian and
          the emotional, between rational design and the decorative arts, but
          the balance of power is shifting: In the battle between the head and
          the gut, the gut’s now cleaning up.

          The empathy economy is booming. Facts are out, feelings are in. This
          is attributed, at least in part, to a kind of brand-mania that asserts
          that everything from your razor blade to your public library to the
          IRS needs to have a relatable personality. Everyone is in the business
          of brand management: artists, designers, businesses, celebrities,
          politicians, museums, universities, armies, nations. (Is it only a
          matter of time before we’re debating our intergalactic positioning?)
          Branding is supposedly not about what something says, or what it
          means, but how it makes us feel. A brand is a promise. It’s the
          putative guarantee of the emotional payoff on an investment in a
          particular product, place, or individual. So the new handbag makes us
          feel chic and knowing; the laptop, savvy and contemporary; the vodka,
          suave and sophisticated; the museum, refined and sensitive. When we
          talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently
          delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at
          least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to
          produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to
          experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look
          alike, but it all has to feel alike. Whenever we encounter them we get
          that familiar brand sensation. That tingling tells you its working.

          So if the goal of design is emotional coherence, how is that end
          achieved? Enter the mood board: the most quotidian,
          slightly-embarrassing and now ubiquitous design tool. The mood board
          has long been associated with the softer design arts — fashion,
          interiors, styling — that trade in allusion and affect. Decorators
          used them, serious architects didn’t. There’s no science to it, simply
          a collection of inspirations and influences: an array of Xeroxed
          pictures pinned to a foamcore panel or scattered on the studio floor,
          a cloud of references composed to evoke atmosphere. Their very
          vaporousness is the point. Pictures joined together don’t signify any
          one thing, but rather inchoate feelings. An image of a silky kitty,
          when juxtaposed with an angora bunny, a desiccated dandelion, and an
          eskimo anorak, is freed from the bonds of the corporeal and becomes
          the essence of fluffiness. For the professional brand manager the mood
          board attempts to render, in a handful of swiped images, some vague
          quintessence that’s difficult to achieve with words.

          For fashion designers who are required to pump out a new set of
          allusions every season, the mood board has long been an essential and
          highly confidential way to pinpoint explicit references before
          assiduously burying their tracks. One former Calvin Klein designer
          recalls how when she worked at the brand in the 00’s, the mood boards
          were sacrosanct. Only certain people were allowed to touch them. The
          foamcore was covered in different materials — linen for one
          collection, cotton for another — and the teams was required to use
          specific pins. The boards could only be carried one at a time, never
          stacked, lest the surface was disturbed. As almost proof of how far
          we’ve come, last spring for his men’s collection, Raf Simmons came
          right out and superimposed his reference images — a Japanese block
          print, an antique postcard, an astronaut — directly onto coats and
          jackets. He likened pieces in the collection to “mood boards you’d pin
          your favorite images to.”

          As the longing for emotional connection spreads from how we want our
          clothes or living room to feel, to how we want our minivan or
          pharmaceutical or constitutional democracy to feel, the mood business
          continues to expand. (A friend recently told me her therapist
          encouraged her to make a mood board expressing the feelings related to
          her recent divorce.) This expansion is fueled, in large part, by the
          sheer overabundance of available images. It’s hard to remember that a
          couple of decades ago, finding pictures of things was actually quite
          arduous and involved countless hours of random page flipping. Now a
          few seconds of furious key-stroking produces endless examples to
          regurgitate. Every possible idea is immediately diluted by retroactive
          references. That glut of images is constantly resifted through
          personal curation tools such as Pinterest and Tumblr, and inspiration
          websites such as ffffound.com or vfiles.com. Such
          hyper-individualistic online collections, in turn, become open-source
          mood repositories scavenged by branding professionals. Why assemble
          collections of your own when there are millions that exist ready for
          appropriation? Need to evoke cozy softness with a vaguely synthetic
          overtone, an early seventies color palette, and just a touch of glam
          rock? Missile silo chic? Mid-century Crimean beach culture? I can
          guarantee someone out there has that covered. There are even Pinterest
          pages dedicated to collecting other mood boards: collections of
          collections. And then, of course, there is Instagram, which turns
          every individual life into a social network mood board. The carefully
          curated Instagram account is essentially a personal image management
          tool: private life as public brand.

          While the ascendency of mood boarding reflects the way brands, from
          commercial products to people, are imagined at this moment, the
          question remains why we are all so susceptible to manufactured
          emotion. Why are we so needy? Perhaps this yearning is a reaction to
          the lurking presence of Big Data. As vast files of meta-data and
          personal search histories are ferreted away in some server farm in
          god-knows-where, we crave the kind of anodyne, gauzy experiences that
          at least promise something warmer and more human. When everything is
          available all the time and we’re inundated with information in every
          way, shape and form, we’re left no choice but to favor what makes us
          feel.
